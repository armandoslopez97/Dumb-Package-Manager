# Dumb-Package-Manager

This is dumpkg, the most bare bones package manager ever.
I wrote it as a proof of concept one night.
It has three commands; install, remove, and update.

It copies binaries from a server to your machine.

To use it, you'll have to change the directories listed in the files.
They were local to my machines, but now they're just gibberish.

It's worth noting that this package manager only deals in binaries and is useless to most people,
except maybe someone handling the distribution of software over a LAN.

There are a few more features I'd like to implement, but for now I'm happy with how it functions.


EDIT:
I looked back at this old project today. I'd initially changed it to private
because, I thought it was useless or, perhaps worse, was poorly written and that this reflected on me.
I've chosen to make it public again, however, because, I now realize that it absolutely is 
useless and poorly written and that DOES reflect on me, or at least it did.
I've grown since I wrote this.
I hope my more recent code speaks to that.
The choice to make this public again, is so that everyone can look back at who I was and see how far I've come.
I plan to keep going.
