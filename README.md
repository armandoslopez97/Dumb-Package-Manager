# Dumb-Package-Manager

This is dumpkg, the most bare bones package manager ever.
I wrote it as a proof of concept one night.
It has three commands; install, remove, and update.

It copies binaries from a server to your machine.

To use it, you'll have to change the directories listed in the files.
They were local to my machines, but now they're just gibberish.

It's worth noting that this package manager only deals in binaries and is useless to most people,
except maybe someone handling the distribution of software over a LAN.

There are a few more features I'd like to implement, but for now I'm happy with how it functions.
